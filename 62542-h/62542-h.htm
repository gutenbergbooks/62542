<p class="drop-cap">On the afternoon of 6
December 1941, Tai
Sing Loo, the colorful
Pearl Harbor Navy
Yard photographer, arranged
with Platoon Sergeant
Charles R. Christenot, the noncommissioned-officer-in-charge
of the
Main Gate at the Navy Yard, to have
his Marines pose for a photograph
between 0830 and 0930 Sunday
morning, in front of the new concrete
main gate. The photo was to be for
a Christmas card.</p>

<p>As war clouds gathered over the
Pacific basin in late 1941, the United
States Pacific Fleet operated, as it
had since May 1940, from Pearl Harbor.
While the security of that fleet
and for the island of Oahu lay in the
Army’s hands, that of the Navy Yard
and the Naval Air Stations at Pearl
Harbor and Kaneohe Bay lay in the
hands of Marines. In addition, on
board the fleet’s battleships, aircraft
carriers, and some of its cruisers, Marines
provided security, served as orderlies
for embarked flag officers and
ships’ captains, and manned secondary
antiaircraft and machine gun
batteries—seagoing duties familiar to
the Corps since its inception.</p>

<p>The Marine Barracks at Pearl Harbor
comprised a Barracks Detachment
and two companies, A and B,
the men living in a comfortable
three-story concrete barracks. Company
A manned the main gates at the
Submarine Base and Navy Yard, and
other “distant outposts,” providing
yard security, while Company B enforced
traffic regulations and maintained
proper police and order under
the auspices of the Yard Police
Officer. In addition, Marines ran the
Navy Yard Fire Department. Elements
of Marine defense battalions
made Pearl Harbor their home, too,
residing in the several 100-man temporary
wooden barracks buildings
that had been completed during 1940
and 1941. Less commodious but no
less important was the burgeoning
airbase that Marines of Marine Aircraft
Group (MAG) 2 (later 21) had
hewn and hammered out near Barbers
Point—Ewa Mooring Mast Field,
home for a Marine aircraft group
consisting of fighting, scout-bombing,
and utility squadrons.</p>

<p>On 27 November, having been privy
to intelligence information
gleaned from intercepted and translated
Japanese diplomatic message
traffic, Admiral Harold R. Stark, the
Chief of Naval Operations, and General
George C. Marshall, the Army’s
Chief of Staff, sent a war warning to
their principal commanders on
Oahu, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel,
the Commander in Chief, Pacific
Fleet, and Lieutenant General Walter
C. Short, the Commander of the
Hawaiian Department. Thus adjured
to take appropriate defensive measures,
and feeling that his more exposed
advance bases needed
strengthening, Kimmel set in motion
a plan that had been completed as
early as 10 November, to provide
planes for Midway and Wake. The
latter was to receive fighters—12
Grumman F4F-3 Wildcats of Marine
Fighter Squadron (VMF) 211—while
Midway was to get scout bombers
from Marine Scout-Bomber Squadron
(VMSB) 231. The following day,
28 November 1941, the carrier <i>Enterprise</i>
(CV-6) departed Pearl in Task<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
Force 8 under Vice Admiral William
F. Halsey, Jr., Commander, Aircraft,
Battle Force, embarking VMF-211 at
sea. VMSB-231 was to embark in
another carrier, <i>Lexington</i> (CV-2), in
Task Force 12 under Rear Admiral
John H. Newton, on 5 December.</p>

visible just to left of center. Several temporary wooden barracks,
completed in early 1941, ring the parade ground.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>At the outset, apparently no one
except the squadron commanders
knew their respective destinations,
but the men of VMF-211 and
VMSB-231, meanwhile, apparently
ordered their affairs and made ready
for what was to appear as “advanced
base exercises.” Among those men
seeing to his financial affairs at Ewa
Mooring Mast Field on 3 December
1941 was First Lieutenant Richard E.
Fleming, USMCR, who wrote to his
widowed mother: “This is the last
time I’ll be able to write for probably
some time. I’m sorry I can’t give
you any details; it’s that secret.”</p>

<p>On the 5th, Task Force 12 sailed
from Pearl. Eighteen light gray
Vought SB2U-3 Vindicators from
VMSB-231, under 41-year old Major
Clarence J. “Buddy” Chappell, then
made the 1.7-hour flight from Ewa
and landed on board <i>Lexington</i>,
along with the “Lady Lex” air group.
Planes recovered, the force set course
for Midway. The <i>Lexington</i> departed
Pearl Harbor on the morning of
5 December. That afternoon saw the
arrival of Battleship Division One
from gunnery exercises in the
Hawaiian Operating Area, and the
three dreadnoughts, <i>Arizona</i>
(BB-39), <i>Nevada</i> (BB-36), and <i>Oklahoma</i>
(BB-37), moored in their assigned
berths at the quays along Ford
Island. The movements of the ships
in and out of Pearl Harbor had been
the object of much interest on the
part of the espionage system operating
out of the Japanese consulate in
Honolulu throughout the year 1941,
for the information its operatives
were providing went to support an
ambitious and bold operation that
had taken shape over several months.</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to Admiral Kimmel,
a Japanese task force under the command
of Vice Admiral Chuichi
Nagumo, formed around six carriers
and the most powerful force of its
kind ever assembled by any naval
power, had set out from the remote
Kurile Islands on 27 November. It
observed radio silence and steamed
via the comparatively less traveled
northern Pacific.</p>

<p>Nagumo’s mission was to destroy
the United States Pacific Fleet and
thus ensure its being unable to threaten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
the Japanese Southern Operation
poised to attack American, British,
and Dutch possessions in the Far
East. All of the warning signs made
available to Admiral Kimmel and
General Short pointed toward hostilities
occurring within the forseeable
future, but not on Oahu. War,
however, was about to burst upon
the Marines at Pearl Harbor “like a
thunderclap from a clear sky.”</p>

<h3><i>Suddenly Hurled into War</i></h3>

<p>Some 200 miles north of Oahu,
Vice Admiral Nagumo’s <i>First Air
Fleet</i>—formed around the aircraft
carriers <i>Akagi</i>, <i>Kaga</i>, <i>Soryu</i>, <i>Hiryu</i>,
<i>Shokaku</i> and <i>Zuikaku</i>—pressed
southward in the pre-dawn hours of
7 December 1941. At 0550, the dark
gray ships swung to port, into the
brisk easterly wind, and commenced
launching an initial strike of 184
planes 10 minutes later. A second
strike would take off after an hour’s
interval. Once airborne, the 51 Aichi
D3A1 Type 99 dive bombers (Vals),
89 Nakajima B5N2 attack planes
(Kates) used in high-level bombing
or torpedo bombing roles, and 43
Mitsubishi A6M2 Type 00 fighters
(Zeroes), led by Commander Mitsuo
Fuchida, <i>Akagi</i>’s air group commander,
wheeled around, climbed to
3,000 meters, and droned toward the
south at 0616. The only other military
planes aloft that morning were
Douglas SBD Dauntlesses from <i>Enterprise</i>,
flying searches ahead of the
carrier as she returned from Wake Island,
Army Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses
heading in from the mainland,
and Navy Consolidated PBY Catalinas
on routine patrols out of the
naval air stations at Ford Island and
Kaneohe.</p>

<p>That morning, 15 of the ships at
Pearl Harbor numbered Marine
detachments among their complements:
eight battleships, two heavy
cruisers, four light cruisers, and one
auxiliary. A 16th detachment, assigned
to the auxiliary (target/gunnery
training ship) <i>Utah</i>
(AG-16), was ashore on temporary
duty at the 14th Naval District Rifle
Range at Puuloa Point.</p>

<p>At 0753, Lieutenant Frank Erickson,
USCG, the Naval Air Station
(NAS) Ford Island duty officer,
watched Privates First Class Frank
Dudovick and James D. Young, and
Private Paul O. Zeller, USMCR—the
Marine color guard—march up and
take post for Colors. Satisfied that all
looked in order outside, Erickson
stepped back into the office to check
if the assistant officer-of-the-day was
ready to play the recording for
sounding Colors on the loudspeaker.
The sound of two heavy explosions,
however, sent the Coast Guard
pilot running to the door. He reached
it just in time to see a Kate fly past
1010 Dock and release a torpedo.
The markings on the plane—“which
looked like balls of fire”—left no question
as to its identity; the explosion
of the torpedo as it struck the battleship
<i>California</i> (BB-44), moored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
near the administration building, left
no doubt as to its intent.</p>

<p><i>While a Marine, foreground, looks skyward, the torpedoed

flies “Old Glory,” raised by PFCs Frank Dudovick
and James D. Young, and Pvt Paul O. Zeller, USMCR.</i></p></div></div>

<p>“The Marines didn’t wait for
colors,” Erickson recalled later, “The
flag went right up but the tune was
general quarters.” As “all Hell” broke
loose around them, Dudovick,
Young, and Zeller unflinchingly
hoisted the Stars and Stripes “with
the same smartness and precision”
that had characterized their participation
in peacetime ceremonies. At
the crew barracks on Ford Island,
Corporal Clifton Webster and Private
First Class Albert E. Yale headed for
the roof immediately after general
quarters sounded. In the direct line
of fire from strafing planes, they set
up a machine gun. Across Oahu, as
Japanese planes swept in over NAS
Kaneohe Bay, the Marine detachment
there—initially the only men
who had weapons—hurried to their
posts and began firing at the attackers.</p>

<p>Since the American aircraft carriers
were at sea, the Japanese targeted
the battleships which lay moored
off Ford Island. At one end of Battleship
Row lay <i>Nevada</i>. At 0802, the
battleship’s .50-caliber machine guns
opened fire on the torpedo planes
bearing down on them from the
direction of the Navy Yard; her gunners
believed that they had shot one
down almost immediately. An instant
later, however, a torpedo
penetrated her port side and exploded.</p>

<p>Ahead of <i>Nevada</i> lay <i>Arizona</i>,
with the repair ship <i>Vestal</i> (AR-4)
alongside, preparing for a tender
availability. Major Alan Shapley had
been relieved the previous day as
detachment commanding officer by
Captain John H. Earle, Jr., who had
come over to <i>Arizona</i> from <i>Tennessee</i>
(BB-43). Awaiting transportation
to the Naval Operating Base, San
Diego, and assignment to the 2d Marine
Division, Shapley was lingering
on board to play first base on the battleship’s
baseball team in a game
scheduled with the squad from the
carrier <i>Enterprise</i> (CV-6). After the
morning meal, he started down to his
cabin to change.</p>

<p>Seated at breakfast, Sergeant John
M. Baker heard the air raid alarm,
followed closely by an explosion in
the distance and machine gun fire.
Corporal Earl C. Nightingale, leaving
the table, had paid no heed to the
alarm at the outset, since he had no
antiaircraft battle station, but ran to
the door on the port side that opened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
out onto the quarterdeck at the
sound of the distant explosion. Looking
out, he saw what looked like a
bomb splash alongside <i>Nevada</i>. Marines
from the ship’s color guard then
burst breathlessly into the messing
compartment, saying that they were
being attacked.</p>

<p>As general quarters sounded, Baker
and Nightingale, among the
others, headed for their battle stations.
Aft, congestion at the starboard
ladder, that led through
casemate no. 9, prompted Second
Lieutenant Carleton E. Simensen,
USMCR, the ship’s junior Marine
officer, to force his way through.
Both Baker and Nightingale noted,
in passing, that the 5-inch/51 there
was already manned, and Baker
heard Corporal Burnis L. Bond, the
gun captain, tell the crew to train it
out. Nightingale noted that the men
seemed “extremely calm and collected.”</p>

<p>As Lieutenant Simensen led the
Marines up the ladder on the starboard
side of the mainmast tripod,
an 800-kilogram converted armor-piercing
shell dropped by a Kate
from <i>Kaga</i> ricocheted off the side of
Turret IV. Penetrating the deck, it exploded
in the vicinity of the captain’s
pantry. Sergeant Baker was following
Simensen up the mainmast when
the bomb exploded, shrapnel cutting
down the officer as he reached the
first platform. He crumpled to the
deck. Nightingale, seeing him flat on
his back, bent over him to see what
he could do but Simensen, dying,
motioned for his men to continue on
up the ladder. Nightingale continued
up to Secondary Aft and reported to
Major Shapley that nothing could be
done for Simensen.</p>

<p>An instant later, a rising babble of
voices in the secondary station
prompted Nightingale to call for silence.
No sooner had the tense quiet
settled in when, suddenly, a terrible
explosion shook the ship, as a second
800-kilogram bomb—dropped by a
Kate from <i>Hiryu</i>—penetrated the
deck near Turret II and set off <i>Arizona</i>’s
forward magazines. An instant
after the terrible fireball mushroomed
upward, Nightingale looked out and
saw a mass of flames forward of the
mainmast, and much in the tradition
of Private William Anthony of the
<i>Maine</i> reported that the ship was
afire.<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> “We’d might as well go below,”
Major Shapley said, looking around,
“we’re no good here.” Sergeant Baker
started down the ladder. Nightingale,
the last man out, followed
Shapley down the port side of the
mast, the railings hot to the touch as
they made their way below.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> Private Anthony, an instant after the explosion
mortally damaged the battleship <i>Maine</i> in Havana
harbor on 15 February 1898, made his way to the
captain’s cabin, where he encountered that officer
in the passageway outside. Drawing himself to attention,
Anthony reported that the ship was
sinking.</p></div>

<p>Baker had just reached the searchlight
platform when he heard someone
shout: “You can’t use the ladder.”
Private First Class Kenneth D. Goodman,
hearing that and apparently assuming
(incorrectly, as it turned out)
that the ladder down was indeed unusable,
instinctively leapt in desperation
to the crown of Turret III.
Miraculously, he made the jump with
only a slight ankle injury. Shapley,
Nightingale, and Baker, however,
among others, stayed on the ladder
and reached the boat deck, only to
find it a mass of wreckage and fire,
with the bodies of the slain lying
thick upon it. Badly charred men
staggered to the quarterdeck. Some
reached it only to collapse and never
rise. Among them was Corporal
Bond, burned nearly black, who had
been ordering his crew to train out
no. 9 5-inch/51 at the outset of the
battle; sadly, he would not survive
his wounds.</p>

<p>Shapley and Corporal Nightingale
made their way across the ship between
Turret III and Turret IV, where
Shapley stopped to talk with Lieutenant
Commander Samuel G. Fuqua,
<i>Arizona</i>’s first lieutenant and,
by that point, the ship’s senior officer
on board. Fuqua, who appeared “exceptionally
calm,” as he helped men
over the side, listened as Shapley told
him that it appeared that a bomb had
gone down the stack and triggered
the explosion that doomed the ship.
Since fighting the massive fires consuming
the ship was a hopeless task,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
Fuqua told the Marine that he had
ordered <i>Arizona</i> abandoned. Fuqua,
the first man Sergeant Baker encountered
on the quarterdeck, proved an
inspiration. “His calmness gave me
courage,” Baker later declared, “and
I looked around to see if I could help.”
Fuqua, however, ordered him over
the side, too. Baker complied.</p>

<p>Shapley and Nightingale, meanwhile,
reached the mooring quay
alongside which <i>Arizona</i> lay when
an explosion blew them into the
water. Nightingale started swimming
for a pipeline 150 feet away but soon
found that his ebbing strength would
not permit him to reach it. Shapley,
seeing the enlisted man’s distress,
swam over and grasped his shirt
front, and told him to hang onto his
shoulders. The strain of swimming
with Nightingale, however, proved
too much for even the athletic
Shapley, who began to experience
difficulties himself. Seeing his former
detachment commander foundering,
Nightingale loosened his grip on
his shoulders and told him to go the
rest of the way alone. Shapley
stopped, however, and firmly
grabbed him by the shirt; he refused
to let go. “I would have drowned,”
Nightingale later recounted, “but for
the Major.” Sergeant Baker had seen
their travail, but, too far away to
help, made it to Ford Island alone.</p>

<p>Several bombs, meanwhile, fell
close aboard <i>Nevada</i>, moored astern
of <i>Arizona</i>, which had begun to
hemorrhage fuel from ruptured
tanks. Fire spread to the oil that lay
thick upon the water, threatening
<i>Nevada</i>. As the latter counterflooded
to correct the list, her acting commanding
officer, Lieutenant
Commander Francis J. Thomas,
USNR, decided that his ship had to
get underway “to avoid further
danger due to proximity of <i>Arizona</i>.”
After receiving a signal from the yard
tower to stand out of the harbor,
<i>Nevada</i> singled up her lines at 0820.
She began moving from her berth 20
minutes later.</p>

<p><i>Oklahoma</i>, <i>Nevada</i>’s sister ship
moored inboard of <i>Maryland</i> in
berth F-5, meanwhile manned air-defense
stations at about 0757, to the
sound of gunfire. After a junior
officer passed the word over the
general announcing system that it
was not a drill—providing a suffix of
profanity to underscore the fact—all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
men not having an antiaircraft
defense station were ordered to lay
below the armored deck. Crews at
the 5-inch and 3-inch batteries,
meanwhile, opened ready-use lockers.
A heavy shock, followed by a
loud explosion, came soon thereafter
as a torpedo slammed home in the
battleship’s port side. The “Okie”
soon began listing to port.</p>

<p>Oil and water cascaded over the
decks, making them extremely slippery
and silencing the ready-duty
machine gun on the forward superstructure.
Two more torpedoes struck
home. The massive rent in the ship’s
side rendered the desperate attempts
at damage control futile. As Ensign
Paul H. Backus hurried from his
room to his battle station on the signal
bridge, he passed his friend Second
Lieutenant Harry H. Gaver, Jr.,
one of <i>Oklahoma</i>’s Marine detachment
junior officers, “on his knees,
attempting to close a hatch on the

Turret I] ... part of the trunk which
led from the main deck to the magazines....
There were men trying
to come up from below at the time

Backus never saw Gaver again.</p>

<p>As the list increased and the oily,
wet decks made even standing up a
chore, <i>Oklahoma</i>’s acting commanding
officer ordered her abandoned to
save as many lives as possible.
Directed to leave over the starboard
side, away from the direction of the
roll, most of <i>Oklahoma</i>’s men
managed to get off, to be picked up
by boats arriving to rescue survivors.
Sergeant Thomas E. Hailey, and Privates
First Class Marlin “S” Seale and
James H. Curran, Jr., swam to the
nearby <i>Maryland</i>. Hailey and Seale
turned to the task of rescuing shipmates,
Seale remaining on
<i>Maryland</i>’s blister ledge throughout
the attack, pulling men from the
water. Later, although inexperienced
with that type of weapon, Hailey
and Curran manned <i>Maryland</i>’s antiaircraft
guns. <i>West Virginia</i> rescued
Privates George B. Bierman and Carl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
R. McPherson, who not only helped
rescue others from the water but also
helped to fight that battleship’s fires.</p>

<p><i>Cpl Willard A. Darling, circa 1941, was
awarded the Navy Cross for heroism in
the aftermath of the Japanese air attack
on the battleship</i> Oklahoma (<i>BB-37</i>).</p></div></div>

<p>A little over two weeks shy of his
23d birthday, Corporal Willard D.
Darling, an <i>Oklahoma</i> Marine who
was a native Oklahoman, had meanwhile
clambered on board a motor
launch. As it headed shoreward,
Darling saw 51-year-old Commander
Fred M. Rohow (Medical Corps), the
capsized battleship’s senior medical
officer, in a state of shock, struggling
in the oily water. Since Rohow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
seemed to be drowning, Darling unhesitatingly
dove in and, along with
Shipfitter First Class William S. Thomas,
kept him afloat until a second
launch picked them up. Strafing
Japanese planes and shrapnel from
American guns falling around them
prompted the abandonment of the
launch at a dredge pipeline, so
Darling jumped in and directed the
doctor to follow him. Again, the Marine
rescued Rohow—who proved
too exhausted to make it on his
own—and towed him to shore.</p>

<p><i>Maryland</i>, meanwhile, inboard of
<i>Oklahoma</i>, promptly manned her
antiaircraft guns at the outset of the
attack, her machine guns opening
fire immediately. She took two bomb
hits, but suffered only minor
damage. Her Marine detachment
suffered no casualties.</p>

<p>On board <i>Tennessee</i> (BB-43), Marine
Captain Chevey S. White, who
had just turned 28 the day before,
was standing officer-of-the-deck
watch as that battleship lay moored
inboard of <i>West Virginia</i> (BB-48) in
berth F-6. Since the commanding
officer and the executive officer were
both ashore, command devolved
upon Lieutenant Commander James
W. Adams, Jr., the ship’s gunnery
officer. Summoned topside at the
sound of the general alarm and hearing
“all hands to general quarters”
over the ship’s general announcing
system, Adams sprinted to the bridge
and spotted White en route. Over the
din of battle, Adams shouted for the
Marine to “get the ship in condition
Zed [Z] as quickly as possible.” White
did so. By the time Adams reached
his battle station on the bridge,
White was already at his own battle
station, directing the ship’s antiaircraft
guns. During the action (in
which the ship took one bomb that
exploded on the center gun of Turret
II and another that penetrated the
crown of Turret III, the latter breaking
apart without exploding), White
remained at his unprotected station,
coolly and courageously directing the
battleship’s antiaircraft battery. <i>Tennessee</i>
claimed four enemy planes
shot down.</p>

  <div class="caption">

<p><i>Capt Chevey S. White was a veteran of
service in China with the 4th Marines,
where he had edited the</i> Walla Walla, <i>the
regiment’s news magazine. White had
become CO of</i> Tennessee<i>’s</i> (<i>BB-43</i>) <i>Marine
Detachment on 3 August 1941. Ultimately,
he was killed by enemy
mortar fire on Guam on 22 July 1944.</i></p></div></div>

<p><i>West Virginia</i>, outboard of <i>Tennessee</i>,
had been scheduled to sail for
Puget Sound, due for overhaul, on
17 November, but had been retained
in Hawaiian waters owing to the
tense international situation. In her
exposed moorings, she thus absorbed
six torpedoes, while a seventh blew
her rudder free. Prompt counterflooding,
however, prevented her
from turning turtle as <i>Oklahoma</i> had
done, and she sank, upright, alongside
<i>Tennessee</i>.</p>

<p>On board <i>California</i>, moored singly
off the administration building at
the naval air station, junior officer of
the deck on board had been Second
Lieutenant Clifford B. Drake.
Relieved by Ensign Herbert C. Jones,
USNR, Drake went down to the
wardroom for breakfast (Kadota
figs, followed by steak and eggs)
where, around 0755, he heard airplane
engines and explosions as
Japanese dive bombers attacked the
air station. The general quarters
alarm then summoned the crew to
battle stations. Drake, forsaking his
meal, hurried to the foretop.</p>

<p>By 0803, the two ready machine
guns forward of the bridge had
opened fire, followed shortly thereafter
by guns no. 2 and 4 of the antiaircraft
battery. As the gunners
depleted the ready-use ammunition,
however, two torpedoes struck home
in quick succession. <i>California</i> began
to settle as massive flooding occurred.
Meanwhile, fumes from the
ruptured fuel tanks—she had been
fueled to 95 percent capacity the
previous day—drove out the men assigned
to the party attempting to
bring up ammunition for the guns by
hand. A call for men to bring up additional
gas masks proved fruitless,
as the volunteers, who included Private
Arthur E. Senior, could not
reach the compartment in which they
were stored.</p>

<p><i>California</i>’s losing power because
of the torpedo damage soon relegated
Lieutenant Drake, in her foretop,
to the role of “... a reporter of what
was going on ... a somewhat confused
young lieutenant suddenly
hurled into war.” As <i>California</i> began
listing after the torpedo hits, Drake
began pondering his own ship’s fate.
Comparing his ship’s list with that of
<i>Oklahoma</i>’s, he dismissed <i>California</i>’s
rolling over, thinking, “who ever
heard of a battleship capsizing?” <i>Oklahoma</i>,
however, did a few moments
later.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at about 0810, in
response to a call for a chain of
volunteers to pass 5-inch/25 ammunition,
Private Senior again stepped
forward and soon clambered down
to the C-L Division Compartment.
There he saw Ensign Jones, Lieutenant
Drake’s relief earlier that
morning, standing at the foot of the
ladder on the third deck, directing
the ammunition supply. For almost
20 minutes, Senior and his shipmates
toiled under Jones’ direction until a
bomb penetrated the main deck at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
about 0830 and exploded on the second
deck, plunging the compartment
into darkness. As acrid smoke
filled the compartment, Senior
reached for his gas mask, which he
had lain on a shell box behind him,
and put it on. Hearing someone say:
“Mr. Jones has been hit,” Senior
flashed his flashlight over on the ensign’s
face and saw that “it was all
bloody. His white coat also had
blood all over it.” Senior and another
man then carried Jones as far as the
M Division compartment, but the
ensign would not let them carry him
any further. “Leave me alone,” he
gasped insistently, “I’m done for. Get
out of here before the magazines go
off!” Soon thereafter, however, before
he could get clear, Senior felt the
shock of an explosion from down below
and collapsed, unconscious.</p>

in casemate no. 9, on the starboard side.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Jones’ gallantry—which earned
him a posthumous Medal of
Honor—impressed Private Howard
M. Haynes, who had been confined
before the attack, awaiting a bad
conduct discharge. After the battle,
a contrite Haynes—“a mean character
who had shown little or no
respect for anything or anyone” before
7 December—approached Lieutenant
Drake and said that he
[Haynes] was alive because of the actions
that Ensign Jones had taken.
“God,” he said, “give me a chance to
prove I’m worth it.” His actions that
morning in the crucible of war
earned Haynes a recommendation
for retention in the service. Most of
<i>California</i>’s Marines, like Haynes,
survived the battle. Private First
Class Earl D. Wallen and Privates
Roy E. Lee, Jr. and Shelby C. Shook,
however, did not. Nor did the badly
burned Private First Class John A.
Blount, Jr., who succumbed to his
wounds on 9 December.</p>

<p><i>Nevada</i>’s attempt to clear the harbor,
meanwhile, inspired those who
witnessed it. Her magnificent effort
prompted a stepped-up effort by
Japanese dive bomber pilots to sink
her. One 250-kilogram bomb hit her
boat deck just aft of a ventilator
trunk and 12 feet to the starboard
side of the centerline, about halfway
between the stack and the end of the
boat deck, setting off laid-out 5-inch
ready-use ammunition. Spraying
fragments decimated the gun crews.
The explosion wrecked the galley
and blew open the starboard door of
the compartment, venting into casemate
no. 9 and starting a fire that
swept through the casemate, wrecking
the gun. Although he had been
seriously wounded by the blast that
had hurt both of his legs and stripped
much of his uniform from his body,
Corporal Joe R. Driskell disregarded
his own condition and insisted
that he man another gun. He refused
medical treatment, assisting other
wounded men instead, and then
helped battle the flames. He did not
quit until those fires were out.</p>

<p>Another 250-kilogram bomb hit
<i>Nevada</i>’s bridge, penetrating down
into casemate no. 6 and starting a
fire. The blast had also severed the
water pipes providing circulating
water to the water-cooled machine
guns on the foremast-guns in the
charge of Gunnery Sergeant Charles
E. Douglas. Intense flames enveloped
the forward superstructure, endangering
Douglas and his men, and
prompting orders for them to abandon
their station. They steadfastly
remained at their posts, however,
keeping the .50-caliber Brownings firing
amidst the swirling black smoke
until the end of the action.</p>

<p>Unlike the battleships the enemy
had caught moored on Battleship
Row, <i>Pennsylvania</i> (BB-38), the fleet
flagship, lay on keel blocks, sharing
Dry Dock No. 1 at the Navy Yard
with <i>Cassin</i> (DD-372) and <i>Downes</i>
(DD-375)—two destroyers side-by-side
ahead of her. Three of <i>Pennsylvania</i>’s
four propeller shafts had been
removed and she was receiving all
steam, power, and water from the
yard. Although her being in drydock
had excused her from taking part in
antiaircraft drills, her crew swiftly
manned her machine guns after the
first bombs exploded among the PBY
flying boats parked on the south end
of Ford Island. “Air defense stations”
then sounded, followed by “general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
quarters.” Men knocked the locks off
ready-use ammunition stowage and
<i>Pennsylvania</i> opened fire about
0802.</p>

Private First Class Floyd D.
Stewart—died later the same day.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="dc al"><span class="smcap1">Lieutenant</span> Colonel Daniel
Russel Fox, USMC, as the
Division Marine Officer on the
staff of Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd,
Commander, Battleship Division
One, was the most senior Marine
officer to die on board <i>Arizona</i> on
the morning of 7 December 1941. Fox
had enlisted in the Marine Corps in
1916. For heroism in France on 4 October
1918, when he was a member
of the 17th Company, Fifth Marines,
he was awarded the Navy Cross. He
also was decorated with the Army’s
Distinguished Service Cross and the
French Croix de Guerre. Fox was
commissioned in 1921 and later
served in Nicaragua as well as China.</p></div></div>

<p>As the onslaught descended upon
the battleships and the air station,
Marine detachments hurried to their
battle stations on board other ships
elsewhere at Pearl. In the Navy Yard
lay <i>Argonne</i> (AG-31), the flagship of
the Base Force, the heavy cruisers
<i>New Orleans</i> (CA-32) and <i>San Francisco</i>
(CA-38), and the light cruisers
<i>Honolulu</i> (CL-48), <i>St. Louis</i> (CL-49)
and <i>Helena</i> (CL-50). To the northeast
of Ford Island lay the light cruiser
<i>Phoenix</i> (CL-43).</p>

<p>Although <i>Utah</i> was torpedoed and
sunk at her berth early in the attack,
her 14 Marines, on temporary duty
at the 14th Naval District Rifle
Range, found useful employment
combatting the enemy. The Fleet
Machine Gun School lay on Oahu’s
south coast, west of the Pearl Harbor
entrance channel, at Fort Weaver.
The men stationed there, including
several Marines on temporary duty
from the carrier <i>Enterprise</i> and the
battleships <i>California</i> and <i>Pennsylvania</i>,
sprang to action at the first
sounds of war. Working with the
men from the Rifle Range, all hands
set up and mounted guns, and broke
out and belted ammunition between
0755 and 0810. All those present at
the range were issued pistols or rifles
from the facility’s armory.</p>

<p>Soon after the raid began, Platoon
Sergeant Harold G. Edwards set
about securing the camp against any
incursion the Japanese might attempt
from the landward side, and also supervised
the emplacement of
machine guns along the beach. Lieutenant
(j.g.) Roy R. Nelson, the
officer in charge of the Rifle Range,
remembered the many occasions
when Captain Frank M. Reinecke,
commanding officer of <i>Utah</i>’s Marine
detachment and the senior instructor
at the Fleet Machine Gun School
(and, as his Naval Academy classmates
remembered, quite a conversationalist),
had maintained that the
school’s weapons would be a great
asset if anybody ever attacked
Hawaii. By 0810, Reinecke’s gunners
stood ready to prove the point and
soon engaged the enemy—most likely
torpedo planes clearing Pearl Harbor
or high-level bombers approaching
from the south. Nearby
Army units, perhaps alerted by the
Marines’ fire, opened up soon thereafter.
Unfortunately, the eager gunners
succeeded in downing one of
two SBDs from <i>Enterprise</i> that were
attempting to reach Hickam Field.
An Army crash boat, fortunately,
rescued the pilot and his wounded
passenger soon thereafter.</p>

<p>On board <i>Argonne</i>, meanwhile,
alongside 1010 Dock, her Marines
manned her starboard 3-inch/23 battery
and her machine guns. Commander
Fred W. Connor, the ship’s
commanding officer, later credited
Corporal Alfred Schlag with shooting
down one Japanese plane as it
headed for Battleship Row.</p>

<p>When the attack began, <i>Helena</i> lay
moored alongside 1010 Dock, the
venerable minelayer <i>Oglala</i> (CM-3)
outboard. A signalman, standing
watch on the light cruiser’s signal
bridge at 0757 identified the planes
over Ford Island as Japanese, and the
ship went to general quarters. Before
she could fire a shot in her own
defense, however, one 800-kilogram
torpedo barrelled into her starboard
side about a minute after the general
alarm had begun summoning her
men to their battle stations. The explosion
vented up from the forward
engine room through the hatch and
passageways, catching many of the
crew running to their stations, and
started fires on the third deck. Platoon
Sergeant Robert W. Teague, Privates
First Class Paul F. Huebner, Jr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
and George E. Johnson, and Private
Lester A. Morris were all severely
burned. Johnson later died.</p>

<p>To the southeast, <i>New Orleans</i> lay
across the pier from her sister ship
<i>San Francisco</i>. The former went to
general quarters soon after enemy
planes had been sighted dive-bombing
Ford Island around 0757.
At 0805, as several low-flying torpedo
planes roared by, bound for Battleship
Row, Marine sentries on the
fantail opened fire with rifles and
.45s. <i>New Orleans</i>’ men, meanwhile,
so swiftly manned the 1.1-inch/75
quads, and .50-caliber machine guns,
under the direction of Captain William
R. Collins, the commanding
officer of the ship’s Marine detachment,
that the ship actually managed
to shoot at torpedo planes passing
her stern. <i>San Francisco</i>, however,
under major overhaul with neither
operative armament nor major
caliber ammunition on board, was
thus restricted to having her men fire
small arms at whatever Japanese
planes came within range. Some of
her crew, though, hurried over to
<i>New Orleans</i>, which was near-missed
by one bomb, and helped man her
5-inchers.</p>

<p><i>St. Louis</i>, outboard of <i>Honolulu</i>,
went to general quarters at 0757 and
opened fire with her 1.1 quadruple
mounted antiaircraft and .50-caliber
machine gun batteries, and after getting
her 5-inch mounts in commission
by 0830—although without
power in train—she hauled in her
lines at 0847 and got underway at
0931. With all 5-inchers in full commission
by 0947, she proceeded to
sea, passing the channel entrance
buoys abeam around 1000.
<i>Honolulu</i>, damaged by a near miss
from a bomb, remained moored at
her berth throughout the action.</p>

<p><i>Phoenix</i>, moored by herself in
berth C-6 in Pearl Harbor, to the
northeast of Ford Island, noted the
attacking planes at 0755 and went to
general quarters. Her machine gun
battery opened fire at 0810 on the attacking
planes as they came within
range; her antiaircraft battery five
minutes later. Ultimately, after two
false starts (where she had gotten underway
and left her berth only to see
sortie signals cancelled each time)
<i>Phoenix</i> cleared the harbor later that
day and put to sea.</p>

<p>For at least one Marine, though,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
the day’s adventure was not over
when the Japanese planes departed.
Search flights took off from Ford Island,
pilots taking up utility aircraft
with scratch crews, to look for the
enemy carriers which had launched
the raid. Mustered at the naval air
station on Ford Island, <i>Oklahoma</i>’s
Sergeant Hailey, still clad in his oil-soaked
underwear, volunteered to go
up in a plane that was leaving on a
search mission at around 1130. He
remained aloft in the plane, armed
with a rifle, for some five hours.</p>

<p>After the attacking planes had retired,
the grim business of cleaning
up and getting on with the war had
to be undertaken. Muster had to be
taken to determine who was missing,
who was wounded, who lay dead.
Men sought out their friends and
shipmates. First Lieutenant Cornelius
C. Smith, Jr., from the Marine Barracks
at the Navy Yard, searched in
vain among the maimed and dying
at the Naval Hospital later that day,
for his friend Harry Gaver from <i>Oklahoma</i>.
Death respected no rank.
The most senior Marine to die that
day was Lieutenant Colonel Daniel
R. Fox, the decorated World War I
hero and the division Marine officer
on the staff of the Commander, Battleship
Division One, Rear Admiral
Isaac C. Kidd, who, along with Lieutenant
Colonel Fox, had been killed
in <i>Arizona</i>. The tragedy of Pearl
Harbor struck some families with
more force than others: numbered
among <i>Arizona</i>’s lost were Private
Gordon E. Shive, of the battleship’s
Marine detachment, and his brother,
Radioman Third Class Malcolm H.
Shive, a member of the ship’s
company.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, Marines
from the sunken ships received reassignment
to other vessels—<i>Nevada</i>’s
Marines deployed ashore to set up
defensive positions in the fields adjacent
to the grounded and listing
battleship—and the dead, those who
could be found, were interred with
appropriate ceremony. Eventually,
the deeds of Marines in the battleship
detachments were recognized by appropriate
commendations and advancements
in ratings. Chief among
them, Gunnery Sergeant Douglas,
Sergeant Hailey, and Corporals
Driskell and Darling were each
awarded the Navy Cross. For his
“meritorious conduct at the peril of
his own life,” Major Shapley was
commended and awarded the Silver
Star. Lieutenant Simensen was
awarded a posthumous Bronze Star,
while <i>Tennessee</i>’s commanding officer
commended Captain White for the
way in which he had directed that
battleship’s antiaircraft guns that
morning.</p>

<p>Titanic salvage efforts raised some
of the sunken battleships—<i>California</i>,
<i>West Virginia</i>, and <i>Nevada</i>—and
they, like the surviving Marines,
went on to play a part in the ultimate
defeat of the enemy who had begun
the war with such swift and terrible
suddenness.</p>

<h3><i>They Caught Us Flat-Footed</i></h3>

<p>At 0740, when Fuchida’s fliers had
closed to within a few miles of Kahuku
Point, the 43 Zeroes split away
from the rest of the formation,
swinging out north and west of
Wheeler Field, the headquarters of
the Hawaiian Air Force’s 18th Pursuit
Wing. Passing further to the south,
at about 0745 the <i>Soryu</i> and <i>Hiryu</i>
divisions executed a hard diving turn
to port and headed north, toward
Wheeler. Eleven Zeroes from
<i>Shokaku</i> and <i>Zuikaku</i> simultaneously
left the formation and flew east,
crossing over Oahu north of Pearl
Harbor to attack NAS Kaneohe Bay.
Eighteen from <i>Akagi</i> and <i>Kaga</i> headed
toward what the Japanese called
<em>Babasu Pointo Hikojo</em> (Barbers Point
Airdrome)—Ewa Mooring Mast
Field.</p>

<p>Sweeping over the Waianae Range,
Lieutenant Commander Shigeru
Itaya led <i>Akagi</i>’s nine Zeroes, while
Lieutenant Yoshio Shiga headed
another division of nine from <i>Kaga</i>.
After the initial attack, Itaya and Shiga
were to be followed by divisions
from <i>Soryu</i>, under Lieutenant Masaji
Suganami, and <i>Hiryu</i>, under Lieutenant
Kiyokuma Okajima, which
were, at that moment, involved in attacking
Wheeler to the north.</p>

<p>In the officers’ mess at Ewa, the
officer-of-the-day, Captain Leonard
W. Ashwell of VMJ-252, noticed two
formations of aircraft at 0755. The
first looked like 18 “torpedo planes”
flying at 1,000 feet toward Pearl Harbor
from Barbers Point, but the second,
to the northwest, comprised
about 21 planes, just coming over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
hills from the direction of Nanakuli,
also at an altitude of about 1,000
feet. Ashwell, intrigued by the sight,
stepped outside for a better look. The
second formation, of single-seat
fighters (the two divisions from <i>Akagi</i>
and <i>Kaga</i>), flew just to the north
of Ewa and wheeled to the right.
Then, flying in a “string” formation,
they commenced firing. Recognizing
the planes as Japanese, Ashwell burst
back into the mess, shouting: “Air
Raid ... Air Raid! Pass the word!”
He then sprinted for the guard house,
to have “call to arms” sounded.</p>

(without water) 100 pounds, 8 ounces, and measured
five feet, six inches in length. It fired between 550 and
700 rounds per minute to a maximum horizontal range
of 7,400 yards. The two hoses carry coolant water to
the gun barrel. The gun could be fired without the
prescribed two and a half gallons of cooling water—as
Gunnery Sergeant Douglas’s men did on board <i>Nevada</i>
(BB-36) on 7 December 1941—but accuracy
diminished as the barrel heated and the pattern of
shots became more widely dispersed. Experience
would reveal that a large number of .50-caliber hits
were necessary to disable a plane, and that only a
small number of hits could be attained by any single
ship-mounted gun against a dive bomber.</p></div></div>

<p>That Sunday morning, Technical
Sergeant Henry H. Anglin, the
noncommissioned-officer-in-charge
of the photographic section at Ewa,
had driven from his Pearl City home
with his three-year-old son, Hank, to
take the boy’s picture at the station.
The senior Anglin had just positioned
the lad in front of the camera
and was about to take the photo—the
picture was to be a gift to the
boy’s grandparents—when they
heard the “mingled noise of airplanes
and machine guns.” Roaring down to
within 25 feet of the ground, Itaya’s
group most likely carried out only
one pass at their targets before moving
on to Hickam, the headquarters
of the Hawaiian Air Forces 18th
Bombardment Wing.</p>

<p><i>LCdr Shigeru Itaya, commander of</i> Akagi’<i>s

<p>Thinking that Army pilots were
showing off, Sergeant Anglin stepped
outside the photographic section tent
and, along with some other enlisted
men, watched planes bearing
Japanese markings strafing the edge
of the field. Then, the planes began
roaring down toward the field itself
and the bullets from their cowl and
wing-mounted guns began kicking
up puffs of dirt. “Look, live ammunition,”
somebody said or thought,
“Somebody’ll go to prison for this.”</p>

<p>Shiga’s pilots, like Itaya’s, concentrated
on the tactical aircraft lined up
neatly on Ewa’s northwest apron
with short bursts of 7.7- and
20-millimeter machine gun fire. Shiga’s
pilots, unlike Itaya’s, however,
reversed course over the treetops and
repeated their blistering attacks from
the opposite direction. Within
minutes, most of MAG-21’s planes sat
ablaze and exploding, black smoke
corkscrewing into the sky. The enemy
spared none of the planes: the
gray SBD-1s and -2s of VMSB-232
and the seven spare SB2U-3s left behind
by VMSB-231 when they embarked
in <i>Lexington</i> just two days
before. VMF-211’s remaining F4F-3s,
left behind when the squadron
deployed to Wake well over a week
before, likewise began exploding in
flame and smoke.</p>

<p>At his home on Ewa Beach, three
miles southeast of the air station,
Captain Richard C. Mangrum,
VMSB-232’s flight officer, sat reading
the Sunday comics. Often residents
of that area had heard gunnery
exercises, but on a Sunday morning?
The chatter of gunfire and the dull
thump of explosions, however, drew
Mangrum’s attention away from the
cartoons. As he looked out his front
door, planes with red ball markings
on the wings and fuselage roared by
at very low altitude, bound for Pearl
Harbor. Up the valley in the direction
of Wheeler Field, smoke was
boiling skyward, as it was from Ewa.
As he set out for Ewa on an old country
road, wives and children of Marines
who lived in the Ewa Beach
neighborhood began gathering at the
Mangrum’s house.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the Ewa Beach community,
Mrs. Charles S. Barker, Jr.,
wife of Master Technical Sergeant
Barker, the chief clerk in MAG-21’s
operations office, heard the noise and
asked: “What’s all the shooting?” Barker,
clad only in beach shorts, looked
out his front door, saw and heard a
plane fly by at low altitude, and then
saw splashes along the shoreline from
strafing planes marked with red
<em>hinomaru</em>. Running out to turn off
the water hose in his front yard, and
seeing a small explosion nearby
(probably an antiaircraft shell from
the direction of Pearl), Barker had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
seen enough. He left his wife and
baby with his neighbors, and set out
for Ewa.</p>

<p>The strafers who singled out cars
moving along the roads that led to
Ewa proved no respecter of persons.
MAG-21’s commanding officer, Lieutenant
Colonel Claude A. “Sheriff”
Larkin, en route from Honolulu, was
about a mile from Ewa in his 1930
Plymouth when a Zero shot at him.
He momentarily abandoned the car
for the relative sanctuary of a nearby
ditch, not even bothering to turn
off the engine, and then, as the
strafer roared out of sight, sprinted
back to the vehicle, jumped back in,
and sped on. He reached his destination
at 0805—just in time to be
machine gunned again by one of Admiral
Nagumo’s fighters. Soon thereafter,
Larkin’s good fortune at
remaining unwounded amidst the attack
ran out, as he suffered several
penetrating wounds, the most painful
of which included one on the top
of the middle finger of his left hand
and another on the front of his lower
left leg just above the top of his
shoe. Refusing immediate medical attention,
though, Larkin continued to
direct the defense of Ewa Field.</p>

Photography Section, stands before the mooring mast field’s dispensary on 8
December 1941, solemnly displaying the slug that wounded him on the 7th.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Pilots and ground crewmen alike
rushed out onto the mat to try to save
their planes from certain destruction.
At least a few pilots intended to get
airborne, but could not because most
of their aircraft were either afire or
riddled beyond any hope of immediate
use.</p>

<p>Captain Milo G. Haines of
VMF-211 sought safety behind a
tractor, he and the machine’s driver
taking shelter on the side opposite to
the strafers. Another Zero came in
from another angle, however, and
strafed them from that direction.
Spraying bullets clipped off Haines’
necktie just beneath his chin. Then,
as a momentarily relieved Haines put
his right hand at the back of his head
a bullet lacerated his right little finger
and a part of his scalp.</p>

<p>In the midst of the confusion, an
excited three-year-old Hank Anglin
innocently took advantage of his
father’s distraction with the battle
and wandered toward the mat. All of
the noise seemed like a lot of fun.
Sergeant Anglin ran after his son, got
him to the ground, and, shielding
him with his own body, crawled
some 35 yards, little puffs of dirt
coming near them at times. As they
clambered inside the radio trailer to
get out of harm’s way, a bullet made
a hole above the door. Moving back
to the photo tent, the elder Anglin
put his son under a wooden bench.
As he set about gathering his camera
gear to take pictures of the action, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
bullet went through his left arm.
Deprived of the use of that arm for
a time, Anglin returned to the bench
under which his son still crouched
obediently, to see little Hank point
to a spent bullet on the floor and hear
him warn: “Don’t touch that, daddy,
it’s hot.”</p>

<p>Private First Class James W. Mann,
the driver assigned to Ewa’s 1938 Ford
ambulance, had been refueling the
vehicle when the attack began. When
Lieutenant Thomas L. Allman, Medical
Corps, USN, the group medical
officer, saw the first planes break into
flames, he ordered Mann to take the
ambulance to the flight line. Accompanied
by Pharmacist’s Mate 2d
Class Orin D. Smith, a corpsman
from sick bay, they sped off. The
Japanese planes seemed to be attracted
to the bright red crosses on the
ambulance, however, and halted its
progress near the mooring mast.
Realizing that they were under attack,
Mann floored the brake pedal
and the Ford screeched to a halt.
Rather than leave the vehicle for a
safer area, Mann and Smith crawled
underneath it so that they
could continue their mission as
quickly as possible. The strafing,
however, continued unabated. Ironically,
the first casualty Mann had to
collect was the man lying prone beside
him. Orin Smith felt a searing
pain as one of the Japanese
7.7-millimeter rounds found its mark
in the fleshy part of his left calf. Seeing
that the corpsman had been hurt,
Mann assisted him out from under
the vehicle and up into the cab.
Despite continued strafing that shot
out four tires, Mann pressed doggedly
ahead and delivered the wounded
Smith to sick bay.</p>

bleeding was stopped and the painful
wound was cleaned and dressed,
Private First Class Mann sprinted to
his own tent. Grabbing his rifle, he
then returned to the battered ambulance

drove toward Ewa’s garage. There,
Master Technical Sergeant Lawrence
R. Darner directed his men to replace
the damaged tires with those from a
mobile water purifier. Meanwhile,
Smith resumed his duties as a member
of the dressing station crew.</p>

<p>Also watching the smoke beginning
to billow skyward was Sergeant
Duane W. Shaw, USMCR, the driver
of the station fire truck. Normally,
during off-duty hours, the truck sat
parked a quarter-mile from the landing
area. Shaw, figuring that it was
his job to put out the fires, climbed
into the fire engine and set off. Unfortunately,
like Private First Class
Mann’s ambulance, Sergeant Shaw’s
bright red engine moving across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
embattled camp soon attracted strafing
Zeroes. Unfazed by the enemy
fire that perforated his vehicle in
several places, he drove doggedly
toward the flight line until another
Zero shot out his tires. Only then
pausing to make a hasty estimate of
the situation, he reasoned that with
the fire truck at least temporarily out
of service he would have to do something
else. Jumping down from the
cab, he soon got himself a rifle and
some ammunition. Then, he set out
for the flight line. If he could not put
out fires, he could at least do some
firing of his own at the men who
caused them.</p>

<p>With the parking area cloaked in
black smoke, Japanese fighter pilots
shifted their efforts to the planes
either out for repairs in the rear areas
or to the utility planes parked north
of the intersection of the main runways.
Inside ten minutes’ time,
machine gun fire likewise transformed
many of those planes into
flaming wreckage.</p>

<p>Firing only small arms and rifles
in the opening stages, the Marines
fought back against <i>Kaga</i>’s fighters
as best they could, with almost reckless
heroism. Lieutenant Shiga
remembered one particular Leatherneck
who, oblivious to the machine
gun fire striking the ground around
him and kicking up dirt, stood transfixed,
emptying his sidearm at Shiga’s
Zero as it roared past. Years later,
Shiga would describe that lone, defiant,
and unknown Marine as the
bravest American he had ever met.</p>

<p>A tragic drama, however, soon unfolded
amidst the Japanese attack.
One Marine, Sergeant William E.
Lutschan, Jr., USMCR, a truckdriver,
had been “under suspicion” of espionage
and he was ordered placed under
arrest. In the exchange of gunfire
that followed his resisting being
taken into custody, though, he was
shot dead. With that one exception,
the Marines at Ewa Field had fought
back to a man.</p>

  <div class="caption">

<p><i>Ewa’s 1938 Ford ambulance, seen after the Japanese raid, its Red Cross status violated, took over 50 hits from strafing planes.</i></p></div></div>

<p>As if <i>Akagi</i>’s and <i>Kaga</i>’s fighters
had not sown enough destruction on
Ewa, one division of Zeroes from
<i>Soryu</i> and one from <i>Hiryu</i> arrived
on the scene, fresh from laying waste
to many of the planes at Wheeler
Field. This second group of fighter pilots
went about their work with the
same deadly precision exhibited at
Wheeler only minutes before. The
raid caught Master Technical Sergeant
Darner’s crew in the middle of
changing the tires on the station’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
ambulance. Private First Class Mann,
who by that point had managed to
obtain some ammunition for his rifle,
dropped down with the rest of
the Marines at the garage and fired
at the attacking fighters as they
streaked by.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Kiyokuma Okajima led
his six fighters down through the rolling
smoke, executing strafing attacks
until ground fire holed the forward
fuel tank of his wingman, Petty
Officer 1st Class Kazuo Muranaka.
When Okajima discovered the
damage to Muranaka’s plane, he
decided that his men had pressed
their luck far enough, and began to
assemble his unit and shepherd them
toward the rendezvous area some 10
miles west of Kaena Point. The retiring
Japanese in all likelihood then
spotted incoming planes from <i>Enterprise</i>
(CV-6), that had been launched
at 0618 to scout 150 miles ahead of
the ship in nine two-plane sections.
Their planned flight path to Pearl
was to take many of them over Ewa
Mooring Mast Field, where some
would encounter Japanese aircraft.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back at Ewa, after
what must have seemed an eternity,
the Zeroes of the first wave at last
wheeled away toward their rendezvous
point. Having made a shambles
of the Marine air base, Japanese pilots
claimed the destruction of 60 aircraft
on the ground: <i>Akagi</i>’s airmen
accounted for 11, <i>Kaga</i>’s 15, <i>Soryu</i>’s
12, and <i>Hiryu</i>’s 22. Their figures were
not too far off the mark, for 47 aircraft
of all types had been parked at
the field at the beginning of the onslaught,
33 of which had been fully
operational.</p>

<p>Although the Japanese had
wreaked havoc upon MAG-21’s complement
of planes, the group’s casualties
seemed miraculously light.
Apparently, the enemy fighter pilots
in the first wave maintained a fairly
high degree of discipline, eschewing
attacks on people and concentrating
their attacks on machines. Many of
Ewa’s Marines, however, had parked
their cars near the center of the station.
By the time the Japanese departed,
the parking lot resembled a junk
yard of mangled automobiles of various
makes and models.</p>

<p>Overcoming the initial shock of
the first strafing attack, Ewa’s Marines
took stock of their situation. As
soon as the last of Itaya’s and Shiga’s
Zeroes had departed, Marines went
out and manned stations with rifles
and .30-caliber machine guns taken
from damaged aircraft and from the
squadron ordnance rooms. Technical
Sergeant William G. Turnage, an armorer,
supervised the setting up of
the free machine guns. Technical Sergeant
Anglin, meanwhile, took his
little boy to the guard house, where
a woman motorist agreed to drive
Hank home to his mother. As it
would turn out, that reunion was not
to be accomplished until much later
that day, “inasmuch as the distraught
mother had already left home to look
for her son.”</p>

<p>Master Technical Sergeant Emil S.
Peters, a veteran of action in
Nicaragua, had, during the first attack,
reported to the central ordnance
tent to lend a hand in manning a gun.
By the time he arrived there,
however, there were none left to
man. Then he saw a Douglas SBD-2,
one of two spares assigned to
VMSB-232, parked behind the squadron’s
tents. Enlisting the aid of Private
William G. Turner, VMSB-231’s
squadron clerk, Peters ran over to the
ex-<i>Lexington</i> machine that still bore
her USN markings, 2-B-6, pulled the
after canopy forward, and clambered
in the after cockpit, stepping hard on
the foot pedal to unship the free
.30-caliber Browning from its housing
in the after fuselage, and then
locking it in place. Turner, having obtained
a supply of belted ammunition,
took his place on the wing as
Peters’ assistant.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, nursing his painfully
wounded finger and leg, Lieutenant
Colonel Larkin ordered extra guards
posted on the perimeter of the field
and on the various roads leading into
the base. Men not engaged in active
defense went to work fighting the
many fires. Drivers parked what
trucks and automobiles had remained
intact on the runways to prevent
any possible landings by
airborne troops. Although hardly
transforming Ewa into a fortress, the
Marines ensured that they would be
ready for any future attack.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, most of the men at
Ewa expected—correctly—that the
Japanese would return. At about
0835, enemy planes again made their
appearance in the sky over Ewa, but
this time, Marines stood or crouched
ready and waiting for what proved
to be Lieutenant Commander Takahashi’s
dive bombing unit from
<i>Shokaku</i>, returning from its attacks
on the naval air station at Pearl Harbor
and the Army’s Hickam Field,
roaring in from just above the
treetops. Initially, their targets appeared
to be the planes, but, seeing
that most had already been destroyed,
the enemy pilots turned to
strafing buildings and people in a
“heavy and prolonged” assault.</p>

<p><i>At their barracks, near the foundation of a swimming pool
under construction, three Marines gingerly seek out good vantage
points from which to fire, while two peer skyward, keeping
their eyes peeled for attacking Japanese planes. Headgear
varies from Hawley helmet to garrison cap to none, but the
weapon is the same for all—the Springfield 1903 rifle.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Better prepared than they had been
when Lieutenant Commander Itaya’s
Zeroes had opened the battle, Ewa’s
Marines met Takahashi’s Vals with
heavy fire from rifles, Thompson
submachine guns, .30-caliber
machine guns, and even pistols. In
retaliation, after completing their
strafing runs, the Japanese pilots
pulled up in steep wing-overs, allowing
their rear seat gunners to take advantage
of the favorable deflection
angle to spray the defenders with
7.7-millimeter bullets. Marine observers
later recounted that <i>Shokaku</i>’s
planes also dropped light
bombs, perhaps of the 60-kilogram
variety, as they counted five small
craters on the field after the attack.</p>

<p>In response to the second onslaught,
as they had in the first, all
available Marines threw themselves
into the desperate defense of their
base. The additional strafing attacks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
started numerous fires within the
camp area, adding new columns of
dense smoke to those still rising from
the planes on the parking apron. Unfortunately,
the ground fire seemed
far more brave than accurate, because
all of <i>Shokaku</i>’s dive bombers
repeatedly zoomed skyward, seemingly
unhurt. Even taking into account
possible damage sustained
during attacks over Ford Island and
Hickam, only four of Takahashi’s
planes sustained any damage over
Oahu before they retired. The departure
of <i>Shokaku’</i>s Vals afforded Lieutenant
Colonel Larkin the
opportunity to reorganize the camp
defenses. There was ammunition to
be distributed, wounded men to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
succored, and seemingly innumerable
fires burning amongst the tents,
buildings, and planes, to be extinguished.</p>

Corps in 1931. Recommended for a letter

<p>However, around 0930, yet
another flight of enemy planes
appeared—about 15 Vals from <i>Kaga</i>
and <i>Hiryu</i>. Although the pilots of
those planes had expended their
250-kilogram bombs on ships at
Pearl Harbor, they still apparently retained
plenty of 7.7-millimeter ammunition,
and seemed determined to
expend much of what remained upon
Ewa. As in the previous attacks by
<i>Shokaku</i>’s Vals, the last group came
in at very low altitude from just over
the tops of the trees surrounding the
station. Quite taken by the high
maneuverability of the nimble dive
bombers, which they were seeing at
close hand for the second time that
day, the Marines mistook them for
fighter aircraft with fixed landing
gear.</p>

<p>Around that time, Lieutenant
Colonel Larkin saw an American
plane and a Japanese one collide in
mid-air a short distance away from
the field. In all probability, Larkin
saw <i>Enterprise</i>’s Ensign John H. L.
Vogt’s Dauntless collide with a Val.
Vogt had become separated from his
section leader during the Pearl-bound
flight in from the carrier, may
have circled offshore, and then arrived
over Ewa in time to encounter
dive bombers from <i>Kaga</i> or <i>Hiryu</i>.
Vogt and his passenger, Radioman
Third Class Sidney Pierce, bailed out
of their SBD, but at too low an altitude,
for both died in the trees when
their ’chutes failed to deploy fully.
Neither of the Japanese crewmen escaped
from their Val when it crashed.</p>

<p><i>TSgt Emil S. Peters, seen here on 11 October
1938, was a veteran of service in
Nicaragua and a little more than three
weeks shy of his 48th birthday when
Japanese bombers attacked Ewa Field.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Fortunately for the Marines,
however, the last raid proved comparatively
“light and ineffectual,”
something Lieutenant Colonel Larkin
attributed to the heavy gunfire
thrown skyward. The short respite
between the second and third strafing
attacks had allowed Ewa’s
defenders to bring all possible
weapons to bear against the
Japanese. Technical Sergeant Turnage,
after having gotten the base’s
machine guns set up and ready for
action, took over one of the mounts
himself and fired several bursts into
the belly of one Val that began trailing
smoke and began to falter soon
thereafter.</p>

<p>Turnage, however, was by no means
the only Marine using his
weapon to good effect. Master Technical
Sergeant Peters and Private
Turner, from their improvised position
in the lamed SBD, had let fly at
whatever Vals came within range of
their gun. The two Marines shot
down what witnesses thought were
at least two of the attacking planes
and discouraged strafing in that area
of the station. However, the Japanese
soon tired of the tenacious bravery
of the grizzled veteran and the young
clerk, neither of whom flinched in
the face of repeated strafing. Two
particular enemy pilots repeatedly
peppered the grounded Dauntless
with 7.7-millimeter fire, ultimately
scoring hits near the cockpit area and
wounding both men. Turner toppled
from the wing, mortally wounded.</p>

<p>Another Marine who distinguished
himself during the third
strafing attack was Sergeant Carlo A.
Micheletto of Marine Utility Squadron
(VMJ) 252. During the first
Japanese attack that morning,
Micheletto proceeded at once to
VMJ-252’s parking area and went to
work, helping in the attempts to extinguish
the fires that had broken out
amongst the squadron’s parked utility
planes. He continued in those
labors until the last strafing attack
began. Putting aside his firefighting
equipment and grabbing a rifle, he
took cover behind a small pile of
lumber, and heedless of the heavy
machine-gunning, continued to fire
at the attacking planes until a burst
of enemy fire struck him in the head
and killed him instantly.</p>

<p>Eventually, in an almost predictable
way, the Japanese planes formed
up and flew off to the west, leaving
the once neatly manicured Mooring
Mast Field smouldering. The Marines
had barely had time to catch
their collective breath when, at 1000,
almost as a capstone to the complete
chaos wreaked by the initial Japanese
attack, seven more planes arrived.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Their markings, however, were of
a more familiar variety—red-centered
blue and white stars. The
newcomers proved to be a group of
Dauntlesses from <i>Enterprise</i>. For the
better part of an hour, Lieutenant
Wilmer E. Gallaher, executive officer
of Scouting Squadron 6, had circled
fitfully over the Pacific swells south
of Oahu, waiting for the situation
there to settle down. At about 0945,
when he had seen that the skies
seemed relatively clear of Japanese
planes, Gallaher decided rather than
face friendly fire over Pearl he would
go to Ewa instead. They had barely
stopped on the strip, however, when
a Marine ran out to Gallaher’s plane
and yelled, “For God’s sake, get into
the air or they’ll strafe you, too!”
Other <i>Enterprise</i> pilots likewise saw
ground crews frantically motioning
for them to take off immediately. Instructed
to “take off and stay in the
air until [the] air raid was over,” the
<i>Enterprise</i> pilots took off and headed
for Pearl Harbor. Although all
seven SBDs left Ewa, only three (Gallaher’s,
his wingman, Ensign William
P. West’s, and Ensign Cleo J. Dobson’s)
would make it as far as Ford
Island. A tremendous volume of antiaircraft
fire over the harbor rose to
meet what was thought to be yet
another attack; seeing the reception
accorded Gallaher, West, and Dobson,
the other four pilots—Lieutenant
(jg) Hart D. Hilton and
Ensigns Carlton T. Fogg, Edwin J.
Kroeger, and Frederick T. Weber—wheeled
around and headed back to
Ewa, landing around 1015 to find a
far better reception that time around.
Within a matter of minutes, the Marines
began rearming and refueling
Hilton’s, Kroeger’s and Weber’s SBDs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
The Marines discovered that Fogg’s
Dauntless, though, had taken a hit
that had holed a fuel tank, and
would require repairs.</p>

<p><i>Sgt Carlo A. Micheletto had turned 26
years old less than two months before
Japanese planes strafed Ewa. He was
recommended for a letter of commendation,
but was awarded a Bronze Star.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Although it is unlikely that even
one of the Ewa Marines thought so
at the time, even as they serviced the
<i>Enterprise</i> SBDs which sat on the
landing mat, the Japanese raid on
Oahu was over. Vice Admiral Nagumo,
already feeling that he had
pushed his luck far enough, was
eager to get as far away from the
waters north of Oahu as soon as possible.
At least for the time being, the
Marines at Ewa had nothing to fear.</p>

<p>Not privy to the musings of Nagumo
and his staff, however, Lieutenant
Colonel Larkin could only
wonder what the Marines would do
should the Japanese return. At 1025,
he completed a glum assessment of
the situation and forwarded it to Admiral
Kimmel. While casualties
among the Marines had been light—two
men had been killed and several
wounded—the Japanese had destroyed
“all bombing, fighting, and
transport planes” on the ground. Ewa
had no radio communications, no
power, and only one small gas generator
in commission. He also informed
the Commander-in-Chief,
Pacific Fleet, that he would retain the
four Enterprise planes at Ewa until
further orders. Larkin also notified
Wheeler Field Control of the SBDs
being held at his field.</p>

<p>At 1100, Wheeler called and
directed all available planes to rendezvous
with a flight of B-17s over
Hickam. Lieutenant (jg) Hilton and
the two ensigns from Bombing Squadron
6, Kroeger and Weber, took off
at 1115 and the Marines never heard
from them again. Finding no Army
planes over Hickam (two flights of
B-17s and Douglas A-20s had only
just departed) the three Navy pilots
landed at Ford Island. Ensign Fogg’s
SBD represented the sole naval strike
capability at Ewa as the day ended.</p>

<p>“They caught us flat-footed,” Larkin
unabashedly wrote Major General
Ross E. Rowell of the events of 7
December. Over the next few
months, Ewa would serve as the focal
point for Marine aviation activities
on Oahu as the service acquired
replacement aircraft and began
rebuilding to carry out the mission
of standing ready to deploy with the
fleet wherever it was required.</p>

<h3><i>They’re Kicking the Hell
Out of Pearl Harbor</i></h3>

<p>Although the Japanese accorded
the battleships and air facilities priority
as targets for destruction on the
morning of 7 December 1941, it was
natural that the onslaught touched
the Marine Barracks at Pearl Harbor
Navy Yard as well.</p>

<p>Colonel William E. Farthing,
Army Air Forces, commanding
officer of Hickam Field, thought that
he was witnessing some very realistic
maneuvers shortly before 0800
that morning. From his vantage
point, virtually next door to the
Navy Yard, Farthing watched what
proved to be six Japanese dive bombers
swooping down toward Ford Island.
He thought that MAG-21’s
SB2Us or SBDs were out for an early
morning practice hop. “I wonder
what the Marines are doing to the
Navy so early Sunday?”</p>

<p>Over at the Marine Barracks, the
officer of the guard, Second Lieutenant
Arnold D. Swartz, after having
inspected his sentries, had retired
to the officer-of-the-day’s room to
await breakfast. Stepping out onto
the lanai (patio) at about 0755 to talk
to the field music about morning
colors, he noticed several planes diving
in the direction of the naval air
station. He thought initially that it
seemed a bit early for practice bombing,
but then saw a flash and heard
the resulting explosion that immediately
dispelled any illusions he might
have held that what he was seeing
was merely an exercise. Seeing a
plane with “red balls” on the wings
roar by at low level convinced Swartz
that Japanese planes were attacking.</p>

veritable dynamo, organizing it to
battle the attacking Japanese. He
was killed at Okinawa in June
1945 while commanding the 22d
Marines, but not before his performance
of duty had merited him
the award of his third Navy Cross.</p></div></div>

<p>Over in the squadroom of Barracks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
B, First Lieutenant Harry F.
Noyes, Jr., the range officer for Battery
E, 3-inch Antiaircraft Group, 3d
Defense Battalion, heard the sound
of a loud explosion coming from the
direction of the harbor at about
0750. First assuming that blasting
crews were busy—there had been a
lot of construction recently—Noyes
cocked his ears. The new sounds
seemed a bit different, “more higher-pitched,
and louder.” At that, he
sprang from his bed, ran across the
room, and peered northward just in
time to see a dirty column of water
rising from the harbor from another
explosion and a Japanese plane pulling
out of its dive. The plane, bearing
red <em>hinomaru</em> (rising sun insignia)
under its wings, left no doubt as to
its identity.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The explosions likewise awakened
Lieutenant Colonel William J. Whaling
and Major James “Jerry” Monaghan
who, while Colonel Gilder D.
Jackson, commanding officer of the
Marine Barracks, was at sea in <i>Indianapolis</i>
(CA-35) en route to Johnston
Island for tests of Higgins
landing boats, shared his quarters at
Pearl Harbor. Shortly before 0800,
Whaling rolled over and asked: “Jerry,
don’t you think the Admiral is a
little bit inconsiderate of guests?”
Monaghan, then also awake, replied:
“I’ll go down and see about it.” Whaling,
meanwhile, lingered in bed until
more blasts rattled the quarters’
windows. Thinking that he had not
seen any 5-inch guns emplaced close
to the building, and that something
was wrong, he got up and walked
over to the window that faced the
harbor. Looking out, he saw smoke,
and, turning, remarked: “This thing
is so real that I believe that’s an oil
tank burning right in front there.”
Both men then dressed and hurried
across the parade ground, where they
encountered Lieutenant Colonel Elmer
E. Hall, commanding officer of
the 2d Engineer Battalion. “Elmer,”
Whaling said amiably, “this is a
mighty fine show you are putting on.
I have never seen anything quite like
it.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Swartz ordered the
field music to sound “Call to Arms.”
Then, running into the officer’s section
of the mess hall, Swartz informed
the officer-of-the-day, First
Lieutenant Cornelius C. Smith, Jr.,
who had been enjoying a cup of
coffee with Marine Gunner Floyd
McCorkle when sharp blasts had
rocked the building, that the
Japanese were attacking. Like
Swartz, they ran out onto the lanai.
Standing there, speechless, they
watched the first enemy planes diving
on Ford Island.</p>

<p>Marines began to stumble, eyes
wide in disbelief, from the barracks.
Some were lurching, on the run, into
pants and shirts; a few wore only
towels. Swartz then ordered one of
the platoon sergeants to roust out the
men and get them under cover of the
trees outside. Smith, too, then ran
outside to the parade ground. As he
looked at the rising smoke and the
Japanese planes, he doubted those
who had derided the “Japs” as “cross-eyed,
second-rate pilots who couldn’t
hit the broad side of a barn door.” It
was enough to turn his stomach.
“They’re kicking the hell out of Pearl
Harbor,” he thought.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, unable to reach
Colonel Harry B. Pickett, the 14th
Naval District Marine Officer, as well
as Colonel Jackson, and Captain
Samuel R. Shaw, commanding
officer of Company A, by telephone,
Swartz sent runners to the officers’
respective quarters. He then ordered
a noncommissioned officer from the
quartermaster department to dispense
arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>While Swartz organized the men
beneath the trees outside the barracks,
Lieutenant Noyes dressed and
then drove across the parade ground
to Building 277, arriving about 0805.
At the same time, like Swartz, First
Lieutenant James S. O’Halloran, the
3d Defense Battalion’s duty officer
and commanding officer of Battery
F, 3-inch Antiaircraft Group, wanted
to get in touch with his senior
officers. After having had “assembly”
sounded and signalling his men to
take cover, O’Halloran ordered Marine
Gunner Frederick M. Steinhauser,
the assistant battalion communications
officer, to telephone all
of the officers who resided outside
the reservation and inform them of
the attack.</p>

<p>In Honolulu, mustachioed Major
Harold C. Roberts, acting commanding
officer of the 3d Defense Battalion
since Lieutenant Colonel Robert
H. Pepper had accompanied Colonel
Jackson to sea in <i>Indianapolis</i>, after
taking Steinhauser’s call with word
of the bombing of Pearl, jumped into
his car along with his neighbor,
Major Kenneth W. Benner, commanding
officer of the 3-inch Antiaircraft
Group and the
Headquarters and Service Battery of
the 3d Defense Battalion. As Roberts’
car crept through the heavy traffic
toward Pearl, the two officers could
see Japanese aircraft flying along the
coast. When they reached the Water
Street Fish Market, a large crowd of
what seemed to be “Japanese residents
... cheering the Japanese
planes, waving to them, and trying
to obstruct traffic to Pearl Harbor by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
pushing parked cars into the street”
blocked their way.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Meanwhile, as his acting battalion
commander was battling his way
through Honolulu’s congested streets,
O’Halloran was organizing his Marines
as they poured out of the barracks
into groups to break out small
arms and machine guns from the various
battalion storerooms. After Harry
Noyes drove up, O’Halloran told
him to do what he could to get the
3-inch guns, and fire control equipment,
if available, broken out and set
up, and then instructed other Marines
to “get tractors and start hauling
guns to the parade ground.”
Another detail of men hurried off to
recover an antiaircraft director that
lay crated and ready for shipment to
Midway.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Marines continued to stream out
onto the grounds, having been ordered
out of the barracks with their
rifles and cartridge belts; they doubled
the sentry posts and received instructions
to stand ready and armed,
to deploy in an emergency. Noyes
saw some Marines who had not been
assigned any tasks commencing fire
on enemy planes “which were considerably
out of range.” At the main
gate of the Navy Yard, the Marines
fired at whatever planes came close
enough—sailors from the high-speed
minelayer <i>Sicard</i> (DM-21), en route
to their ship, later attested to seeing
one Japanese plane shot down by the
guards’ rifle fire.</p>

<p>Tai Sing Loo, who was to have
photographed those guards at the
new gate, had left Honolulu in a hurry
when he heard the sound of explosions
and gunfire, and saw the
rising columns of smoke. He arrived
at the naval reservation without his
Graflex and soon marveled at the
cool bravery of the “young, fighting
Marines” who stood their ground,
under fire, blazing away at enemy
planes with rifles while keeping
traffic moving.</p>

<p>Finally, the more senior officers
quartered outside the reservation began
showing up. When Colonel Pickett
arrived, Lieutenant Swartz
returned to the officer-of-the-day’s
room and found that Captain Shaw
had reached there also. Securing
from his position as officer of the
guard, Swartz returned to his 3-inch
gun battery being set up near Building
277. Ordering Marines out of the
building, he managed to obtain a
steel helmet and a pistol each for
himself and Lieutenant O’Halloran.
Captain Samuel G. Taxis, commanding
officer of the 3d Defense Battalion’s
5-inch Artillery Group,
meanwhile, witnessed “terrific confusion”
ensuing from his men’s efforts
to obtain “ammunition, steel helmets,
and other items of equipment.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the comparatively few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
Marines of Lieutenant Colonel Bert
A. Bone’s 1st Defense Battalion—most
of which garrisoned Wake,
Johnston, and Palmyra—made their
presence felt. Urged on by Lieutenant
Noyes, one detail of men immediately
reported to the battalion gun shed
and storerooms, and issued rifles and
ammunition to all comers, while
another detachment worked feverishly
assembling machine guns. Navy
Yard workmen—enginemen Lokana
Kipihe and Oliver Bright, fireman
Gerard Williams, and rigger Ernest
W. Birch—appeared, looking for
some way to help the Marines, who
soon put them to work distributing
ammunition to the machine gun
crews. Soon, the Marines at the barracks
added the staccato hammering
of automatic weapons fire to the
general din around them. Meanwhile,
other Marines from the 1st
Defense Battalion broke out firefighting
equipment, as shrapnel from exploding
antiaircraft shells began to
strike the roof of the barracks and
adjacent buildings.</p>

<p>At about 0820, Majors Roberts
and Benner reached the Marine Barracks
just in time to observe the beginning
of the Japanese second wave
attacks against Pearl. Roberts found
that Lieutenant O’Halloran had gotten
the 3d Battalion ready for battle,
with seven .50-caliber and six
.30-caliber machine guns set up and
with ammunition belted. Under Captain
Harry O. Smith, Jr., commanding
officer of Battery H, Machine
Gun Group, 3d Defense Battalion,
the 3d’s Marine gunners had already
claimed one Japanese plane shot
down. Lieutenant Noyes was, meanwhile,
in the process of deploying
seven 3-inch guns—three on the west
end of the parade ground and four
on the east.</p>

<p>Sergeant Major Leland H. Alexander,
of the Headquarters and Service
Battery of the 3d Defense
Battalion, suggested to Lieutenant
O’Halloran that an armed convoy be
organized to secure ammunition for
the guns, as none was available in the
Navy Yard proper. Roberts gave
Alexander permission to put together
the requisite trucks, weapons, and
men. Lieutenant Colonel Bone had
the same idea, and, accordingly dispatched
a truck at 0830 to the nearest
ammunition dump near Fort Kamehameha.
Bone ordered another
group of men from the 5-inch battery
to the Naval Ammunition Depot at
Lualualei just in case. He hoped that
at least one truck would get through
the maelstrom of traffic. Marines
from the 2d Engineer Battalion made
ammunition runs as well as provided
men and motorcycles for messengers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Roberts directed
Major Benner to have the 3d Battalion’s
guns operational before the ammunition
trucks returned, and to set
the fuzes for 1,000 yards, since the
guns lacked the necessary height-finding
equipment. The makeshift
emplacements, however, presented
less than ideal firing positions since
the barracks and nearby yard buildings
restricted the field of fire, and
many of the low-flying planes appeared
on the horizon only for an
instant.</p>

<p>Necessity often being the mother
of invention, Roberts devised an impromptu
fire control system, stationing
a warning section of eight men,
equipped with field glasses and led
by Lieutenant Swartz, in the center
of the parade ground. The spotters
were to pass the word to a group of
field musics who, using their instruments,
were to sound appropriate
warnings: one blast meant planes approaching
from the north; two blasts,
from the east, and so on.</p>

<p>Taking precautions against fires in
the temporary wooden barracks,
Roberts ordered hoses run out and
extinguishers placed in front of them,
along with shovels, axes, and buckets
of sand (the latter to deal with incendiary
bombs); hose reel and
chemical carts placed near the center
hydrant near the mess hall; and all
possible containers filled with water
for both fighting fires and drinking.
In addition, he ordered cooks and
messmen to prepare coffee and fill every
other container on hand with
water, and organized riflemen in
groups of about 16 to sit on the
ground with an officer or noncommissioned
officer in charge to direct
their fire. He also called for runners
from all groups in the battalion and
established his command post at the
parade ground’s south corner, and
ordered the almost 150 civilians who
had showed up looking for ways to
help out to report to the machine gun
storeroom and fill ammunition belts
and clean weapons. Among other actions,
he also instructed the battalion
sergeant major to be ready to
safeguard important papers from the
headquarters barracks.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Prior to Roberts’ arrival, Lieutenant
(j.g.) William R. Franklin
(Dental Corps), USN, the dental
officer for the 3d Defense Battalion’s
Headquarters and Service Battery,
and the only medical officer present,
had organized first aid and stretcher
parties in the barracks. As the other
doctors arrived, Roberts directed
them to set up dressing stations at
each battalion headquarters and one
at sick bay. Elsewhere, Marines vacated
one 100-man temporary barracks,
the noncommissioned officer’s
club and the post exchange, to ready
them for casualties. Parties of Marines
also reported to the waterfront
area to assist in collecting and transporting
casualties from the ships in
the harbor to the Naval Hospital.</p>

<p>By the time the Marines had gotten
their new fire precautions in
place, the Japanese second wave attack
was in full swing. Although
their pilots selected targets exclusively
from among the Pacific Fleet warships,
the Marines at the barracks in
the Navy Yard still were able to take
the Japanese planes, most of which
seemed to be coming in from the west
and southwest, under fire. While
Marines were busily setting up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
3-inch guns, several civilian yard
workmen grabbed up rifles and
“brought their fire to bear upon the
enemy,” allowing Swartz’s men to
continue their work.</p>

<div id="ip_27" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 35em;">

<p><i>Oily smoke from the burning</i> Arizona (<i>BB-39</i>) <i>boils up in the
background beyond the Navy Yard water towers, one of them,

<p>The Japanese eventually put Major
Roberts’ ingenious fire control
methods—the field musics—to the
test. After hearing four hearty blasts
from the bandsmen, the .50-calibers
began hammering out cones of tracer
that caught two low-flying dive bombers
as they pulled out of their runs
over Pearl, prompting Roberts’ fear
that the ships would fire at them, too,
and hit the barracks. One Val slanted
earthward near what appeared to
be either the west end of the lower
tank farm or the south end of the
Naval Hospital reservation, while the
other, emitting great quantities of
smoke, crashed west-southwest of the
parade ground.</p>

<p>Although the Marines success
against their tormentors must have
seemed sweet indeed, a skeptical
Captain Taxis thought it more likely
that the crews of the two Vals
bagged by the machine gunners had
just run out of luck. Most of the firing,
in his opinion, had been quite
ineffectual, mostly “directed at enemy
planes far beyond range of the
weapons and merely fired into the air
at no target at all.” Gunners on board
the fleet’s warships were faring little
better!</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously with the
dive-bombing attacks, horizontal
bombing attacks began. Major
Roberts noted that the 18 bombers
“flew in two Vees of nine planes each
in column of Vees and [that] they
kept a good formation.” At least
some of those planes appeared to
have bombed the battleship <i>Pennsylvania</i>
and the destroyers <i>Cassin</i> and
<i>Downes</i> in Dry Dock No. 1. In the
confusion, however, Roberts probably
saw two divisions of <i>Kates</i> from
<i>Zuikaku</i> preparing for their attack
runs on Hickam Field. A single division
of such planes from <i>Shokaku</i>,
meanwhile, attacked the Navy Yard
and the Naval Air Station.</p>

<p>Well removed from the barracks,
Marines assigned to the Navy Yards
Fire Department rendered invaluable
assistance in leading critical firefighting
efforts. Heading the department,
Sergeant Harold F. Abbott supervised
the distribution of the
various units, and coordinated the
flood of volunteers who stepped forward
to help.</p>

<p>One of Abbott’s men, Private First
Class Marion M. Milbrandt, with his
1,000-gallon pumper, summoned to
the Naval Hospital grounds, found
that one of <i>Kaga</i>’s Kates—struck by
machine gun fire from the ships
moored in the Repair Basin—had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
crashed near there. The resulting fire,
fed by the crashed plane’s gasoline,
threatened the facility, but Milbrandt
and his crew controlled the blaze.</p>

<p>Other Marine firefighters were
hard at work alongside Dry Dock
No. 1. <i>Pennsylvania</i> had not been the
only ship not fully ready for war,
since she lay immobile at one end of
the drydock. <i>Downes</i> lay in the
dock, undergoing various items of
work, while <i>Cassin</i> had been having
ordnance alterations at the Yard and
thus had none of her 5-inch/38s
ready for firing. Both destroyers soon
came in for some unwanted attention.</p>

<p>As bombs turned the two destroyers
into cauldrons of flames and their
crews abandoned ship, two sailors
from <i>Downes</i>, meanwhile, sprinted
over to the Marine Barracks: Gunner’s
Mate First Class Michael G.
Odietus and Gunner’s Mate Second
Class Curtis P. Schulze. After the
order to abandon ship had been
given, both had, on their own initiative,
gone to the Marine Barracks to
assist in the distribution of arms and
ammunition. They soon returned,
however, each gunner’s mate with a
Browning Automatic Rifle in hand,
to do his part in fighting back.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="caption">
<p class="dc a"><span class="smcap1">A</span> 5-inch/25-caliber open pedestal mount antiaircraft
gun—manned here by sailors on
board the heavy cruiser <i>Astoria</i> (CA-34) in
early 1942—was the standard battleship and heavy
cruiser antiaircraft weapon at Pearl Harbor. The
mount itself weighed more than 20,000 pounds, while
the gun fired a 53.8-pound projectile to a maximum
range (at 45 degrees elevation) of 14,500 yards. It was
a weapon such as this that Sergeants Hailey and
Wears, and Private First Class Curran, after the sinking
of their ship, <i>Oklahoma</i> (BB-37), helped man on
board <i>Maryland</i> (BB-46) on 7 December 1941.</p></div></div>

<p>Utilizing three of the department’s
pumpers, meanwhile, the first firefighters
from the yard, who included
Corporal John Gimson, Privates
First Class William M. Brashear, William
A. Hopper, Peter Kerdikes,
Frank W. Feret, Marvin D. Dallman,
and Corporal Milbrandt, among
them, soon arrived and began to play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
water on the burning ships. At about
0915, four torpedo warheads on
board <i>Downes</i> cooked off and exploded,
the concussion tearing the
hoses from the hands of the men
fighting the blaze and sending fragments
everywhere, temporarily forcing
all hands to retreat to the nearby
road and sprawl there. Knocked flat
several times by the explosions, the
Marines and other firefighters, which
included men from <i>Cassin</i> and
<i>Downes</i>, and civilian yard workmen,
remained on the job.</p>

<p>Explosions continued to wrack the
two destroyers, while subsequent
partial flooding of the dock caused
<i>Cassin</i> to pivot on her forefoot and
heel over onto her sister ship. Working
under the direction of Lieutenant
William R. Spear, a 57-year-old retired
naval officer called to the colors,
the firemen were understandably
concerned that the oil fires burning
in proximity to the two destroyers
might drift aft in the partially flooded
dry dock and breach the caisson,
unleashing a wall of water that
would carry <i>Pennsylvania</i> (three of
whose four propeller shafts had been
pulled for overhaul) down upon the
burning destroyers. Preparing for
that eventuality, Private First Class
Don O. Femmer, in charge of the
750-gallon pumper, stood ready
should the conflagration spread to
the northeast through the dock.</p>

<p>Fortunately, circumstances never
required Femmer and his men to defend
the caisson from fire, but the
young private had more than his
share of troubles, when his pumper
broke down at what could have been
a critical moment. Undaunted, Femmer
made temporary repairs and
stood his ground at the caisson
throughout the raid.</p>

<p>At the opposite end of the dry
dock, meanwhile, Private First Class
Omar E. Hill fared little better with
his 500-gallon pumper. As if the firefighting
labors were not arduous
enough, a ruptured circulating water
line threatened to shut down his fire
engine. Holding a rag on the broken
line while his comrades raced away
to obtain spare parts, Hill kept his
pumper in the battle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, firefighters on the
west side of the dock succeeded in
passing three hoses to men on <i>Pennsylvania</i>’s
forecastle, where they
directed blasts of water ahead of the
ship and down the starboard side to
prevent the burning oil, which resembled
a “seething cauldron,” from drifting
aft. A second 500-gallon engine
crew, led by Private First Class
Dallman, battled the fires at the
southwest end of the drydock,
despite the suffocating oily black
smoke billowing forth from <i>Cassin</i>
and <i>Downes</i>. Eventually, by 1035,
the Marines and other volunteers—who
included the indomitable Tai
Sing Loo—had succeeded in quelling
the fires on board <i>Cassin</i>; those on
board <i>Downes</i> were put out early
that afternoon.</p>

<p>More work, however, lay in store
for Corporal Milbrandt and his crew.
Between 0755 and 0900, three Vals
had attacked the destroyer <i>Shaw</i>
(DD-373), which shared <i>YFD-2</i> with
the little yard tug <i>Sotoyomo</i>. All
three scored hits. Fires ultimately
reached <i>Shaw’</i>s forward magazines
and triggered an explosion that sent
tendrils of smoke into the sky and
severed the ship’s bow. Several other
volunteer units were already battling
the blaze with hose carts and two
350-gallon pumpers sent in from
Honolulu. Milbrandt, aided as well
by the Pan American Airways fire
boat normally stationed at Pearl
City, ultimately succeeded in extinguishing
the stricken destroyer’s fires.</p>

<p>In the meantime, after having
pounded the military installations on
Oahu for nearly two hours, between
0940 and 1000 the Japanese planes
made their way westward to return
to the carrier decks from whence they
had arisen. With the respite offered
by the enemy’s departure (no one
knew for sure whether or not they
would be back), the Marines at last
found time to take stock of their situation.
Fortunately, the Marine Barracks
lay some distance away from
what had interested the Japanese the
most: the ships in the harbor proper.
Although some “shell fragments literally
rained at times” the material loss
sustained by the barracks was slight.
Moreover, it had been American
gunfire from the ships in the harbor,
rather than bombs from Japanese
planes overhead, that had inflicted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
the damage; at one point that morning
a 3-inch antiaircraft shell crashed
through the roof of a storehouse—the
only damage sustained by the
barracks during the entire attack.</p>

<p>Considering the carnage at the airfields
on Oahu, and especially,
among the units of the Pacific Fleet,
only four men of the 3d Defense Battalion
had been wounded: Sergeant
Samuel H. Cobb, Jr., of the 3d
Defense Battalion’s 3-inch Antiaircraft
Group, suffered head injuries
serious enough to warrant his being
transferred to the Naval Hospital for
treatment, while Private First Class
Jules B. Maioran and Private William
J. Whitcomb of the Machine Gun
Group and Sergeant Leo Hendricks
II, of the Headquarters and Service
Battery, suffered less serious injuries.
In addition, two men sent with the
trucks to find ammunition for the
3-inch batteries suffered injuries
when they fell off the vehicles.</p>

<p>In their subsequent reports, the
defense battalion and barracks
officers declined to single out individuals,
noting no outstanding individual
behavior during the
raid—only the steady discharge of
duty expected of Marines. To be sure,
great confusion existed, especially at
first, but the command quickly settled
down to work and “showed no
more than the normal excitement and
no trace of panic or even uneasiness.”
If anything, the Marines tended to
place themselves at risk unnecessarily,
as they went about their business
coolly and, in many cases, “in utter
disregard of their own safety.” Major
Roberts recommended that the entire
3d Defense Battalion be commended
for “their initiative, coolness under
fire, and [the] alacrity with which
they emplaced their guns.”</p>

<p>Commendations, however, were
not the order of the day on 7 December.
Although the Japanese had left,
the Marines expected them to return
and finish the job they had begun
(many Japanese pilots, including
Fuchida, wanted to do just that). If
another attack was to come, there
was much to do to prepare for it. As
the skies cleared of enemy planes, the
Marines at the barracks secured their
establishment and took steps to complete
the work already begun on the
defenses. At 1030, the 3d Defense
Battalion’s corporal of the guard
moved to the barracks and set the
battalion’s radio to the Army Information
Service frequency, thus enabling
them to pass “flash” messages
to all groups. The Marines also distributed
gas masks to all hands.</p>

<p>The morning and afternoon passed
quickly, the men losing track of time.
The initial confusion experienced
during the opening moments of the
raid had by that point given way to
at least some semblance of order, as
officers and noncoms arrived from
leave and began to sort out their
commands. At 1105, the 3d Defense
Battalion’s Battery G deployed to
makeshift defense positions as an infantry
reserve in some ditches dug for
building foundations. All of the
messmen, many of whom had taken
an active hand in the defense of the
barracks against the Japanese attack,
returned to the three general mess
halls and opened up an around-the-clock
service to all comers, including
“about 6,000 meals ... to the civilian
workmen of the navy yard,” a service
discontinued only “after the food
supply at the regular established eating
places could be replenished.”</p>

<p>By 1100, at least some of the
3-inch batteries were emplaced and
ready to answer any future Japanese
raids. At the north end of the parade
ground, the 3d Defense Battalion’s
Battery D stood ready for action at
1135 while another battery, consisting
of three guns and an antiaircraft
director (the one originally earmarked
for Midway) lay at the south
end. At 1220, Major Roberts organized
his battalion’s strength into
six task groups. Task group no. 1 was
to double the Navy Yard guard force,
no. 2 was to provide antiaircraft
defense, and no. 3 was to provide
machine gun defense. No. 4 was to
provide infantry reserve and firefighting
crews, no. 5 was to coordinate
transportation, and no. 6 was
to provide ammunition and equipment,
as well as messing and billeting
support.</p>

<p>By 1300, meanwhile, all of the fires
in Dry Dock No. 1 had been extinguished,
permitting the Marine and
civilian firefighters to secure their
hard-worked equipment. Although
the two battered destroyers, <i>Cassin</i>
and <i>Downes</i>, appeared to be total
losses, those who had battled the
blaze could take great satisfaction in
knowing that they had not only
spared <i>Pennsylvania</i> from serious fire
damage but had also played a major
role in saving the drydock. As Tai
Sing Loo recounted later in his own
brand of English: “The Marines of the
Fire Dep[artmen]t of the Navy Yard
are the Heroes of the Day of Dec. 7,
1941 that save the <i>Cassin</i> and
<i>Downes</i> and USS <i>Pennsylvania</i> in
Dry Dock No. 1.”</p>

<p>Later that afternoon, Battery D’s
four officers and 68 enlisted men,
with four .30-caliber machine guns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
sent along with them for good measure,
moved from the barracks over
to Hickam Field to provide the Army
installation some measure of antiaircraft
protection. Hickam also
benefitted from the provision of the
2d Engineer Battalion’s service and
equipment. After the attack, the battalion’s
dump truck and two bulldozers
lumbered over to the stricken air
base to assist in clearing what remained
of the bombers that had been
parked wingtip to wingtip, and filling
bomb craters.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Around 1530, a Marine patrol approached
Tai Sing Loo, a familiar
figure about the Navy Yard, and
asked him to do them a favor. They
had had no lunch; some had had no
breakfast because of the events of the
day. Going to the garage, Loo rode
his bright red “putput” over to the 3d
Defense Battalion mess hall and
related to his old friend Technical Sergeant
Joseph A. Newland the tale of
the hungry Marines. Newland and
his messmen prepared ham and
chicken sandwiches and Loo made
the rounds of all the posts he could
reach.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In the afternoon and early evening
hours of 7 December, the men
received reports that their drinking
water was poisoned, and that various
points on Oahu were being
bombed and/or invaded. In the absence
of any real news, such alarming
reports—especially when added
to the already nervous state of the
defenders—only fueled the fear and
paranoia prevalent among all ranks
and rates. In addition, most of the
men were exhausted after their exertions
of the morning and afternoon.
Dog-tired, many would remain on
duty for 36 hours without relief.
Drawn, unshaven faces and puffy
eyes were common. Tense, expectant
and anxious Marines and sailors at
Pearl spent a fitful night on the 7th.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>It is little wonder that mistakes
would be made that would have tragic
consequences, especially in the
stygian darkness of that first blacked-out
Hawaiian night following the
raid. Still some hours away from
Oahu, the carrier <i>Enterprise</i> and her
air group had been flying searches
and patrols throughout the day, in a
so-far fruitless effort to locate the
Japanese carrier force. South of
Oahu, one of her pilots spotted what
he thought was a Japanese ship and
<i>Enterprise</i> launched a 31-plane strike
at 1642. Nagumo’s fleet, however,
was homeward bound. While <i>Enterprise</i>
recovered the torpedo planes
and dive bombers after their fruitless
search, she directed the fighters to
land at NAS Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p>Machine guns on board the battleship
<i>Pennsylvania</i> opened fire on the
flight as it came for a landing,
though, and soon the entire harbor
exploded into a fury of gunfire as
cones of tracers converged on the incoming
“Wildcats.” Three of the F4Fs
slanted earthward almost immediately;
a fourth crashed a short time
later. Two managed to land at Ford
Island. The 3d Defense Battalion’s
journalist later recorded that “six
planes with running lights under 400
feet altitude tried Ford Island landing
and were machine gunned.” It was
a tragic footnote to what had been
a terrible day indeed.</p>

<p>The Marines at Pearl Harbor had
been surprised by the attack that
descended upon them, but they rose
to the occasion and fought back in
the “best traditions of the naval service.”
While the enemy had attacked
with tenacity and daring, no less so
was the response from the Marines
on board the battleships and cruisers,
at Ewa Mooring Mast Field, and
at the Marine Barracks. One can only
think that Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto’s
worst fears of America’s “terrible
resolve” and that he had awakened
a sleeping giant would have been
confirmed if he could have peered
into the faces, so deeply etched with
grim determination, of the Marines
who had survived the events of that
December day in 1941.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Pearl Harbor Remembered</h2>

<p>Several of the many memoirs in the Marine Corps Oral
History Collection are by Marines who were serving at
Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, and personally witnessed
the Japanese attack. Two such memoirs—one by
Lieutenant General Alan Shapley and a second by Brigadier
General Samuel R. Shaw—vividly describe the events of
that day as they remembered it. General Shapley, a major
in December 1941, had been relieved as commander of <i>Arizona</i>’s
Marine detachment on the 6th. He recalled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I was just finishing my breakfast, and I was just
about ready to go to my room and get in my baseball
uniform to play the <i>Enterprise</i> for the baseball championship
of the United States Fleet, and I heard this
terrible bang and crash. I thought it was a motor sailer
that they dropped on the fantail, and I ran up there
to see what it was all about. When I got up on deck
there, the sailors were aligned on the railing there, looking
towards Pearl Harbor, and I heard two or three of
them say, ‘This is the best damned drill the Army Air
Corps has ever put on.’ Then we saw a destroyer being
blown up in the dry dock across the way.</p>

<p>The first thing I knew was when the fantail, which
was wood, was being splintered when we were being
strafed by machine guns. And then there was a little
bit of confusion, and I can remember this because they
passed the word on ship that all unengaged personnel
get below the third deck. You see, in a battleship the
third deck is the armored deck, and so realizing what
was going on, this attack and being strafed, the unengaged
personnel were ordered below the third deck.</p>

<p>That started some people going down the ladders.
Then right after that, the <i>Pennsylvania</i>, which was the
flagship of the whole fleet, put up these signals, “Go
to general quarters.” So that meant that the people were
going the other way too. Lt [Carleton E.] Simensen did
quite a job of turning some of the sailors around, and
we went up in the director. [On the way up the mainmast
tripod, Lt Simensen was killed.] He caught a burst
through the heart and almost knocked me off the tripod
because I was behind him on the ladder, and I
boosted him up in the searchlight platform and went
in to my director. And of course when I got up there,
there were only seven or eight men there, and I thought
we were all going to get cooked to death because I
couldn’t see anything but fire below after a while. I
stayed there and watched this whole attack, because
I had a grandstand seat for that, and then it got pretty
hot. Anyway, the wind was blowing from the stern to
the stem and I sent the men down and got those men
off. Then I apparently got knocked off or blown off.</p>

<p>I was pretty close to shore.... There was a dredging
pipeline that ran between the ship and Ford Island.
And I guess that I was only about 25 yards from the
pipeline and 10 yards from Ford Island, and managed
to get ashore. I wasn’t so much covered with oil. I didn’t
have any clothes on. [The burning fuel oil] burnt all
my clothes off. I walked up to the airfield which wasn’t
very bright of me, because this was still being attacked
at first. I wanted to get a machine gun in the administration
building but I couldn’t do that. Then I was given
a boat cloak from one of my men. It was quite a sight
to see 400 or 500 men walking around all burnt, just
like charred steak. You could just see their eyes and
their mouths. It was terrible. Later I went over to the
island and went to the Marine barracks and got some
clothes.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the Marine Barracks, Captain Samuel R. Shaw, who
commanded one of the two barracks companies, vividly
remembered that Sunday morning as well:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The boat guards were in place, and the music was
out there, and the old and new officer of the day. And
we had a music, and a hell of a fine sergeant bugler
who had been in Shanghai. He would stand beside the
officers of the day, and there came the airplanes, and
he looked up and he said, “Captain, those are Japanese
war planes.” And one of the two of them said, “My
God, they are, sound the call to arms.” So the bugler
started sounding the call to arms before the first bomb
hit.</p>

<p>Of course they had already started taking out the
machine guns. They didn’t wait for the key in the OD’s
office, they just broke the door down and hauled out
the machine guns, put them in position. Everybody
that wasn’t involved in that drill grabbed their rifles
and ran out in the parade ground, and starting firing
at the airplanes. They must have had several hundred
men out there with rifles. And every [Japanese] plane
that was recovered there, or pieces of it, had lots of
.30-caliber holes—somebody was hitting them,
machine guns or rifles.</p>

<p>Then I remembered—here we had all these guys on
the post who had not been relieved, and they had been
posted at 4 o’clock, and come 9 o’clock, 9:30 they not
only had not been relieved but had no chow and no
water. So I got hold of the mess sergeant and told him
to organize, to go around to the posts.</p>

<p>They had a depot. At the beginning it was a supply
depot. I told him to send a party over there and draw
a lot of canteens and make sandwiches, and we’d send
water and sandwiches around to the guys on posts until
we found out some way to relieve all these guys, and
get people back. Then he told me that it was fine except
that he didn’t have nearly enough messmen, they
were all out in the parade ground shooting. I think the
second phase of planes came in at that time and we
had a hell of an uproar.</p></blockquote>
